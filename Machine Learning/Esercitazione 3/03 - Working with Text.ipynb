If a word appears often in a particular document, but not in very many documents, it is likely to be very descriptive of the content of that document. <i>scikit-learn</i> implements the tf-idf method in a class: <samp>TfidfVectorizer</samp>, which takes in the text data and does both the bag-of-words feature extraction and the tf-idf transformation. There are several variants of the tf-idf rescaling schema (see wikipedia). The tf-idf score for word $w$ in document $d$ as implemented in <samp>TfidfVectorizer</samp> class is given by: \n","\\begin{equation}\n"," tfidf(w,d) = tf * \\left(\\ln\\left( \\frac{N+1}{N_w+1}\\right)+1\\right)\n","\\end{equation}\n","where $N$ is the number of documents in the training set, $N_w$ is the number of documents in the training set that the word $w$ appears, and $tf$ (the term frequency) is the number of times that the word $w$ appears in the query document $d$ (the document you want to transform or encode). The class also applies L2 normalization after computing the tf-idf representation; in other words, it rescales the representation of each document to have Euclidean length (this simply means each row is divided by its sum of squared entries). Rescaling in this way means that the length of a document (the number of words) does not change the vectorized representation.
